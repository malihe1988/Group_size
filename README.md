# Group_size: Code for Mitigating Algorithmic Bias through Sampling

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation code supporting the paper titled  
**"Mitigating Algorithmic Bias through Sampling: The Role of Group Size and Sample Selection"**  
presented at BIAS 2025 workshop at SIGIR 2025. The code includes various SMOTE-based sampling techniques to mitigate algorithmic bias related to protected attributes, focusing on group size adjustments and sample selection strategies.
